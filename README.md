## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
We propose a multilingual, AI-powered mobile application and chatbot designed specifically for small and marginal farmers. The platform will deliver personalized, real-time agricultural advisory by integrating soil health data, weather patterns, and crop history to provide actionable insights on:

Crop selection based on local conditions and season

Fertilizer usage tailored to soil health

Pest and disease detection using image recognition

Localized weather alerts and predictive insights

Real-time market price tracking of crops

Voice-enabled interactions for low-literacy users

The solution will operate in regional languages, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.

How it Addresses the Problem

This solution directly tackles the core issues faced by small and marginal farmers:

Problem Area	How Our Solution Helps
Lack of scientific crop selection	AI-based recommendation using soil, weather, and historical data
Overuse of chemicals	Customized fertilizer plans and pest detection
Language/digital barriers	Voice support and multilingual interface
Market unawareness	Real-time mandi price updates
Dependency on informal sources	Reliable, data-driven advice at fingertips
Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution

AI + Image Processing: Detect diseases/pests via uploaded crop images.

Offline-first architecture: Supports rural areas with poor internet.

Hyperlocal weather + soil integration: Ensures context-aware recommendations.

Voice-first UX: Enhances adoption by digitally illiterate farmers.

Continuous learning loop: Feedback data refines model accuracy over time.

No existing solution offers this level of personalization, accessibility, and integration in one platform tailored for rural India.

## Technical Approach
Technologies to be Used

Frontend: Flutter (cross-platform, multilingual support)

Backend: Node.js / Django

AI/ML:

TensorFlow / PyTorch (image classification, recommendation system)

NLP models (for regional languages, voice to text)

Database: Firebase / PostgreSQL

APIs:

IMD API (weather)

Government mandi APIs

Soil health card API (if available)

Prototype: Will include mock data for crop recommendation, image-based pest detection, and a multilingual chatbot.
## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility

Leverages readily available APIs and datasets

Uses existing image recognition models, fine-tuned for crops

Developed in phases, starting with 1–2 regional languages

Challenges & Mitigation
Challenge	Strategy
Low digital literacy	Voice UI + community workshops
Limited internet	Offline mode with periodic sync
Diverse languages	Modular NLP models with community inputs
Farmer trust	Collaborate with local NGOs and agri-depts for outreach


## Impact and Benefits
Impact

86% of Indian farmers will benefit, especially those lacking access to expert advice.

Could improve yields by 20–30%, as supported by ICT studies.

Benefits

Social: Empowers farmers, increases digital inclusion.

Economic: Reduces input cost, increases profit margins.

Environmental: Promotes balanced fertilizer use, reducing soil degradation.

Policy-level: Provides data to agri-departments for planning and subsidy targeting.
